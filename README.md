# PROJECT VANGUARD: THE LONG DARK

**Retro OVA cel-shaded space combat for the web** — Three.js (WebGPU renderer,
TSL + hand-written WGSL, compute particles), TypeScript (strict), Vite. No
image or audio assets: every ship, sky, portrait, sound and note of music is
generated.

Four hundred years after the Shattering broke the galaxy's gate network,
the Terran Directorate and the Zenith Hegemony fight a slow war over
Ebon-gas — the black-light isotope that keeps six relit Lanterns burning.
You fly Vanguard, the squadron that goes through first. And beyond a gate
that leads nowhere, something is counting down the primes.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173 — title card → campaign
npm run build          # typecheck + production bundle
npm test               # campaign runner + all 20 missions (node:test)
npm run ai-sim         # headless dogfight/formation sim with pass/fail numbers
npm run balance        # headless combat balance: time-to-kill bands, pass/fail
npm run perf           # frame-time budgets (meaningful on real GPUs only)
npm run shot -- --jpg --shot 'hero:cam=0&t=3'   # headless screenshots
```

Needs a WebGPU browser (Chrome/Edge 113+, Safari 26+, Firefox 141+). WebGL2
still runs (TSL ink twin), but compute particles are disabled there.

## Scenes (`?scene=`)

`flight` (default game) · `showcase` · `hangar` (model sheets) · `paint`
(livery editor) · `spatial` (depth cues) · `dogfight` (AI demo) ·
`combat&stage=capital|shield|smoke|weapons` (damage / shields / weapon
families, `&freeze=S` holds a frame) · `fx`
(particles) · `setpieces&piece=monolith|megagate|derelict|nebula|bastion|pilgrimage|…`
· `comms` · `audio` · `prologue` (the ~60 s cold open; `&t=SECONDS` seeks,
loops as an attract reel). Add `&episode=N` to `flight` to jump into a
campaign episode.

**Prologue.** A new profile sees the cold open once before Episode 1 (skip:
Space / Esc / click); it is also on the title menu, and plays by itself when
the title is left idle. Shots are plain data in `src/cinema/prologue.ts`, run
by a small sequencer (`src/cinema/`): keyframed or rig-tracked cameras in km,
postFx envelopes, captions, music / SFX / stage cues — all pure functions of
time, so any frame can be seeked and screenshotted.

## How it's built

**Rendering.** A scene pass writes an MRT G-buffer (HDR cel colour; view
normal + linear depth in km; ink weight + region id + haze). A hand-written
WGSL kernel draws the ink: inverse-depth Laplacian silhouettes (flat plating
never fires, line weight is scale-invariant), normal creases, and region-id
panel lines, with 12 Hz "line boil". Then aerial haze, emissive-only bloom,
tone map, grade, speed lines / chromatic focal distortion, FXAA. Dynamic
resolution holds the frame budget.

**Space.** Universe positions are float64 on the CPU; the GPU only ever
sees camera-relative coordinates (`WorldSpace`), so a 3 km dreadnought
2,600 km from the origin — or a moon-sized sphere 30,000 km away — doesn't
jitter. Space dust, asteroid belts and haze lanes give parallax and speed.

**Simulation.** Every ship — player, wingmen, enemies, capitals — flies the
same `FlightModel` from the same `ControlState`; only the writer differs
(input vs AI). The ship responds on the frame the input arrives; only the
camera lags. Plain arrays and functions: `Fleet`, `Weapons` (swept-sphere
bolts, tracking beams), `Missiles` (proportional navigation + Itano
spirals), `Capitals` (flak, lances, hangars), `ai/*` (behaviour selection,
maneuvers, formations, turrets).

**Combat.** Every design has stats (hull, shields, regen, mass, agility,
speed, signature) and a loadout (`src/sim/Loadouts.ts`): Directorate pulse
lasers and kinetic autocannon, the Choir's hymn pulse and beam-lance, the
Rustwake scattergun; micro-missile swarms, slow heavy torpedoes that point
defence can shoot down, harpoons. Damage types scale against shields and
hull. Capitals carry four shield facings and a voxel hull, so fire lands on
the plating and wrecks the subsystem under it — turrets, lances, hangars,
engines (she drifts), the shield generator (shields gone for good), the bridge
(fire control lost). Fighters take damage by zone: engines lose thrust, a
shot-up wing rolls, a dying ship trails black smoke. Damage is painted on the
cel hull: scorched patches, screentone hatching, glowing craters.
`npm run balance` holds the numbers (Kestrel vs Cantor 3–8 s, a turret to a
wing of four 5–15 s, a capital to a squadron 60–180 s).

**Story.** Missions are data (`src/game/campaign`), run by
`CampaignRunner` (tested) through a small host adapter: story roles →
teams (renegades, defectors, provokable neutrals), plot armour, script
cues, escorts, dwell zones, set pieces, radio chatter with procedural
anime portraits, codex unlocks, eyecatches and debriefs.

**Sound.** Web Audio synthesis only: faction weapons, explosions, engine and
jump loops, lock tones, radio; a generative OVA-style score with moods that
follow the fight and the story.
