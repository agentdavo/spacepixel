# PROJECT VANGUARD: THE LONG DARK

**Retro OVA cel-shaded space combat for the web** — Three.js (WebGPU renderer,
TSL + hand-written WGSL, compute particles), TypeScript (strict), Vite. No
image or audio assets: every ship, sky, portrait, sound and note of music is
generated.

Four hundred years after the Shattering broke the galaxy's gate network,
the Terran Directorate and the Zenith Hegemony fight a slow war over
Ebon-gas — the black-light isotope that keeps six relit Lanterns burning.
You fly Vanguard, the squadron that goes through first. And beyond a gate
that leads nowhere, something is counting down the primes.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173 — title card → campaign
npm run build          # typecheck + production bundle
npm test               # campaign runner + all 20 missions (node:test)
npm run ai-sim         # headless dogfight/formation sim with pass/fail numbers
npm run perf           # frame-time budgets (meaningful on real GPUs only)
npm run shot -- --jpg --shot 'hero:cam=0&t=3'   # headless screenshots
```

Needs a WebGPU browser (Chrome/Edge 113+, Safari 26+, Firefox 141+). WebGL2
still runs (TSL ink twin), but compute particles are disabled there.

## Docking & trade

Every system has 1–3 stations (seeded): Lantern refineries, fossil-salvage
yards, military bastions, free ports and orbital ports with a landing
tether down to the planet; friendly carriers dock at their bow hangar. Press
**G** within 5 km (no hostiles within 10 km, standing above −50), fly the
ILS corridor, and guidance takes the ship under 1 km (OVA cutaway, iris to
the berth). Docked: buy/sell eight commodities (prices from station type,
faction, slow drift and your own market pressure), repair, rearm missile
rails, read the rumour ticker, launch (**Enter**). Keys on the dock screen:
↑↓ select · →/B buy · ←/V sell · Shift ×5 · R repair · E rearm. Shares,
cargo, standing and rails persist in localStorage. Captures:
`?scene=flight&dock=approach|auto|docked|launch[&station=<id>][&cargo=demo]`.
Pure economy + tests: `src/game/economy.ts`, `tests/economy.test.ts`.

## Contracts & free flight

Between episodes the Reach stays open. After a debrief (or **CONTINUE — FREE
FLIGHT** on the title) you start berthed at a Directorate station; the next
episode is posted as **PRIORITY ORDERS** on every Directorate board, so the
story continues when you choose (the star map lists it; **P** on the map plots
the nearest Directorate berth).

Docked, tab **2 · CONTRACTS** is the station's board: seeded per station, 10
minutes of free flight per repost, reseeded as your standing climbs and
matched to your ship's tier. Eight kinds, each with a named client (comms
portrait) and an OVA mission-brief card:

| Kind | Work | Paid at | Tier I fee |
|---|---|---|---|
| Courier | sealed case to a station by a deadline (tier ≥ II: interceptors at the far end) | consignee | 520 + 460/jump |
| Cargo haul | 2–12 units loaded into your pod here, delivered there (sell one and it's theft) | consignee | 380 + 340/jump + 10 % of cargo value |
| Escort | see a freighter down a lane to a Lantern or station through 1–2 raids | client | 1,500 |
| Bounty | find a named raider in the wrecks and kill them (and their wing) | client | 2,300 + 300/jump |
| Patrol sweep | fly 3–4 nav points in order, clear what's hiding | client | 1,350 + 280/jump |
| Salvage recovery | survey a wreck or golden-age hulk (dwell), recover its flight core, get clear | client | 1,650 + 300/jump |
| Reconnaissance | hold an observation point in a dangerous system, then break contact | client | 1,900 + 320/jump |
| Faction sortie (rare) | join a Directorate picket flight against a Choir Measure | client | 5,200 + 300/jump |

Tier II ×1.75, tier III ×2.8; standing moves fees −12 %…+25 %. Late or
abandoned jobs cost 30 % of the fee and twice the standing. Up to 5 at once.
Accepted work in the current system runs through the campaign runner
alongside normal flight (objective panel top-right, orange nav diamonds,
**C** tracks the next job and plots its route on the star map); fees are paid
on docking. Keys on the tab: ↑↓ · **A** accept · **D** decline · **T** turn
in · **X** abandon. Pure + tested: `src/game/contracts/`,
`tests/contracts.test.ts`. Captures:
`?scene=flight&contract=<kind>&cphase=board|op|pay|map`.

## Scenes (`?scene=`)

`flight` (default game) · `showcase` · `hangar` (model sheets) · `paint`
(livery editor) · `spatial` (depth cues) · `dogfight` (AI demo) · `fx`
(particles) · `setpieces&piece=monolith|megagate|derelict|nebula|bastion|pilgrimage|…`
· `comms` · `audio` · `prologue` (the ~60 s cold open; `&t=SECONDS` seeks,
loops as an attract reel). Add `&episode=N` to `flight` to jump into a
campaign episode.

**Prologue.** A new profile sees the cold open once before Episode 1 (skip:
Space / Esc / click); it is also on the title menu, and plays by itself when
the title is left idle. Shots are plain data in `src/cinema/prologue.ts`, run
by a small sequencer (`src/cinema/`): keyframed or rig-tracked cameras in km,
postFx envelopes, captions, music / SFX / stage cues — all pure functions of
time, so any frame can be seeked and screenshotted.

## How it's built

**Rendering.** A scene pass writes an MRT G-buffer (HDR cel colour; view
normal + linear depth in km; ink weight + region id + haze). A hand-written
WGSL kernel draws the ink: inverse-depth Laplacian silhouettes (flat plating
never fires, line weight is scale-invariant), normal creases, and region-id
panel lines, with 12 Hz "line boil". Then aerial haze, emissive-only bloom,
tone map, grade, speed lines / chromatic focal distortion, FXAA. Dynamic
resolution holds the frame budget.

**Space.** Universe positions are float64 on the CPU; the GPU only ever
sees camera-relative coordinates (`WorldSpace`), so a 3 km dreadnought
2,600 km from the origin — or a moon-sized sphere 30,000 km away — doesn't
jitter. Space dust, asteroid belts and haze lanes give parallax and speed.

**Simulation.** Every ship — player, wingmen, enemies, capitals — flies the
same `FlightModel` from the same `ControlState`; only the writer differs
(input vs AI). The ship responds on the frame the input arrives; only the
camera lags. Plain arrays and functions: `Fleet`, `Weapons` (swept-sphere
bolts, tracking beams), `Missiles` (proportional navigation + Itano
spirals), `Capitals` (flak, lances, hangars), `ai/*` (behaviour selection,
maneuvers, formations, turrets).

**Story.** Missions are data (`src/game/campaign`), run by
`CampaignRunner` (tested) through a small host adapter: story roles →
teams (renegades, defectors, provokable neutrals), plot armour, script
cues, escorts, dwell zones, set pieces, radio chatter with procedural
anime portraits, codex unlocks, eyecatches and debriefs.

**Sound.** Web Audio synthesis only: faction weapons, explosions, engine and
jump loops, lock tones, radio; a generative OVA-style score with moods that
follow the fight and the story.
