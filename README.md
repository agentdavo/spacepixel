# PROJECT VANGUARD: THE LONG DARK

**Retro OVA cel-shaded space combat for the web** — Three.js (WebGPU renderer,
TSL + hand-written WGSL, compute particles), TypeScript (strict), Vite. No
image or audio assets: every ship, sky, portrait, sound and note of music is
generated.

Four hundred years after the Shattering broke the galaxy's gate network,
the Terran Directorate and the Zenith Hegemony fight a slow war over
Ebon-gas — the black-light isotope that keeps six relit Lanterns burning.
You fly Vanguard, the squadron that goes through first. And beyond a gate
that leads nowhere, something is counting down the primes.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173 — title card → campaign
npm run build          # typecheck + production bundle
npm test               # campaign runner + all 20 missions (node:test)
npm run ai-sim         # headless dogfight/formation sim with pass/fail numbers
npm run perf           # frame-time budgets (meaningful on real GPUs only)
npm run shot -- --jpg --shot 'hero:cam=0&t=3'   # headless screenshots
```

Needs a WebGPU browser (Chrome/Edge 113+, Safari 26+, Firefox 141+). WebGL2
still runs (TSL ink twin), but compute particles are disabled there.

## Docking & trade

Every system has 1–3 stations (seeded): Lantern refineries, fossil-salvage
yards, military bastions, free ports and orbital ports with a landing
tether down to the planet; friendly carriers dock at their bow hangar. Press
**G** within 5 km (no hostiles within 10 km, standing above −50), fly the
ILS corridor, and guidance takes the ship under 1 km (OVA cutaway, iris to
the berth). Docked: buy/sell eight commodities (prices from station type,
faction, slow drift and your own market pressure), repair, rearm missile
rails, read the rumour ticker, launch (**Enter**). Keys on the dock screen:
↑↓ select · →/B buy · ←/V sell · Shift ×5 · R repair · E rearm. Shares,
cargo, standing and rails persist in localStorage. Captures:
`?scene=flight&dock=approach|auto|docked|launch[&station=<id>][&cargo=demo]`.
Pure economy + tests: `src/game/economy.ts`, `tests/economy.test.ts`.

## The living Reach

**Planets.** Every system is surveyed on its own seeded stream *after* the
generator and station placement, so lanes, gates, stations and campaign
positions never move: original planets keep name, position, radius and ring
and gain a kind and a look; new planets, moons and landmarks are appended
well clear of everything. One painted shader (`src/world/planets/`) covers
banded gas / ice giants with great storms and ring shadow, height-ramp
terrestrial worlds (contour-band posterisation, Worley craters, caps, two-tone
cloud decks, cyclones), volcanic and burning worlds (glowing crack networks
and lava seas), Lantern-lit worlds (black-light veins) and night-side city
lights on inhabited worlds (from the station data). Landmarks: shattered
moons (tumbling chiselled fragments + rubble), burning worlds, Lantern-lit
worlds. Moons orbit slowly outside rings and station altitudes. Fly into a
ring plane and the disc becomes a place: a wrapping field of ice and rock
chunks thins with height and vanishes in the gaps. Every body has a name and
a line of flavour — on the star map survey panel and the HUD nav.

**Traffic.** Each system has a lane graph (Lanterns, stations, the belt) with
a timetable that is a pure function of the clock (`src/universe/traffic.ts`):
freighters, Ebon tankers, liners, couriers, miners, patrol wings of 2–4.
`src/world/Traffic.ts` materialises the sailings within 24 km (budget 22
ships, nearest first, parked past 32 km) and flies them with the same
FlightModel: slow off the node, lane cruise, slow approach, into a docking bay
or through a Lantern (jump flash; arrivals flash in on the timetable second).
Haulers are neutral (shoot one and it turns); patrols fly their flag and answer
distress calls and hostiles; Rustwake raiders ambush haulers in lawless and
border systems at a deterministic point on the lane — a distress call you can
fly to, with a bounty and standing when you break it. Hull choices are data
(`TRAFFIC_ROLES[role].hulls[flag]`, first id that exists), so civilian designs
drop in without code. Far ships ride the timetable (snapped every 8th frame),
mid-range ones steer every 3rd frame. The star map shows lane volume
(thickness, convoy dots), per-system traffic halos, raider warnings and a
survey panel. Captures: `?reach=body|ring|lane|ambush [&sys=<id>] [&body=<name|index>] [&side=lit|term|night]`,
`?traffic=0` for A/B.

## Scenes (`?scene=`)

`flight` (default game) · `showcase` · `hangar` (model sheets) · `paint`
(livery editor) · `spatial` (depth cues) · `dogfight` (AI demo) · `fx`
(particles) · `setpieces&piece=monolith|megagate|derelict|nebula|bastion|pilgrimage|…`
· `comms` · `audio` · `prologue` (the ~60 s cold open; `&t=SECONDS` seeks,
loops as an attract reel). Add `&episode=N` to `flight` to jump into a
campaign episode.

**Prologue.** A new profile sees the cold open once before Episode 1 (skip:
Space / Esc / click); it is also on the title menu, and plays by itself when
the title is left idle. Shots are plain data in `src/cinema/prologue.ts`, run
by a small sequencer (`src/cinema/`): keyframed or rig-tracked cameras in km,
postFx envelopes, captions, music / SFX / stage cues — all pure functions of
time, so any frame can be seeked and screenshotted.

## How it's built

**Rendering.** A scene pass writes an MRT G-buffer (HDR cel colour; view
normal + linear depth in km; ink weight + region id + haze). A hand-written
WGSL kernel draws the ink: inverse-depth Laplacian silhouettes (flat plating
never fires, line weight is scale-invariant), normal creases, and region-id
panel lines, with 12 Hz "line boil". Then aerial haze, emissive-only bloom,
tone map, grade, speed lines / chromatic focal distortion, FXAA. Dynamic
resolution holds the frame budget.

**Space.** Universe positions are float64 on the CPU; the GPU only ever
sees camera-relative coordinates (`WorldSpace`), so a 3 km dreadnought
2,600 km from the origin — or a moon-sized sphere 30,000 km away — doesn't
jitter. Space dust, asteroid belts and haze lanes give parallax and speed.

**Simulation.** Every ship — player, wingmen, enemies, capitals — flies the
same `FlightModel` from the same `ControlState`; only the writer differs
(input vs AI). The ship responds on the frame the input arrives; only the
camera lags. Plain arrays and functions: `Fleet`, `Weapons` (swept-sphere
bolts, tracking beams), `Missiles` (proportional navigation + Itano
spirals), `Capitals` (flak, lances, hangars), `ai/*` (behaviour selection,
maneuvers, formations, turrets).

**Story.** Missions are data (`src/game/campaign`), run by
`CampaignRunner` (tested) through a small host adapter: story roles →
teams (renegades, defectors, provokable neutrals), plot armour, script
cues, escorts, dwell zones, set pieces, radio chatter with procedural
anime portraits, codex unlocks, eyecatches and debriefs.

**Sound.** Web Audio synthesis only: faction weapons, explosions, engine and
jump loops, lock tones, radio; a generative OVA-style score with moods that
follow the fight and the story.
